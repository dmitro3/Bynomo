            Bynomo started its deployment journey from the BNB Hackathon, developed with guidance from Lucas Liao
            (Solutions Architect @BNBChain) and Vlad Veselov (Business Developer @BNBChain). The project direction,
            execution discipline, and protocol framing were shaped in that builder environment.
