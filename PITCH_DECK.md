## Slide 2 — The Origin

In 2021, I saw a Binomo ad promoted by major influencers. I tried the paper mode — made 10× in a week. I put in three months of savings in real mode and lost everything.

Later I found Reddit threads showing that **Binomo ran algorithms that let users win in demo mode and lose in real mode**. This happened to millions of traders worldwide.

That day I decided to build the transparent, oracle-driven alternative.

> In 2021, sub-1-second on-chain price feeds didn't exist. I waited 5 years. In 2026 Pyth Hermes made it possible. **Bynomo is the result.**

---

## Slide 3 — The Problem

| # | Problem | Scale |
|---|---------|-------|
| 1 | **Web2 binary options are rigged** — Binomo, IQ Option, Quotex use proprietary algorithms that let users win in demo and lose in real mode | 590M+ crypto users, millions defrauded |
| 2 | **No credible Web3 binary options product exists** — the category is wide open at production level | $27.56B market growing at 19.8% CAGR |
| 3 | **Sub-1s oracle feeds didn't exist until 2025** — the technical blocker that made this impossible for 5 years has only just been removed | Pyth Hermes reached production maturity in 2025 |
| 4 | **DeFi trading is too complex** — funding rates, liquidation, wallet sigs per trade, complex UX | 400M daily on-chain transactions with no simple fast-trading product |

---

## Slide 4 — The Solution

**Bynomo is the first on-chain binary options platform with sub-5s oracle-settled rounds across 12 blockchains.**

| Principle | How |
|-----------|-----|
| **No manipulation** | All settlement driven by Pyth Hermes — a public, verifiable oracle feed. No proprietary algorithm. |
| **Instant trades** | No wallet signature per bet — bets are instant off-chain balance ops with on-chain deposit/withdrawal |
| **Simple UX** | Deposit → pick a mode → set amount → bet. Three clicks. Beginner-friendly. |
| **Fully transparent** | Every deposit, withdrawal, and payout is logged in an immutable audit trail |
| **12 blockchains** | SOL · BNB · SUI · NEAR · STRK · XLM · XTZ · INIT · OCT · PUSH · 0G · SOMNIA — one unified UI |

---

## Slide 5 — Product: How It Works

### 3-Step User Journey

```
Step 1 — Fund
Connect any wallet → send mainnet tokens to Bynomo treasury
→ balance credited instantly (Supabase, off-chain)

Step 2 — Trade
Pick a mode · set amount · confirm
No wallet signature needed per bet

Step 3 — Settle
Pyth Hermes resolves the outcome at expiry
Win → payout credited · Lose → house keeps stake
P&L off-chain (Supabase) · deposits/withdrawals on-chain
```

### Game Modes

| Mode | Mechanic | Win Condition |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Box Mode** | Select a pre-drawn multiplier tile on the live chart | Tip of the green price line touches the tile's start within its price band |
| **Draw Mode** | Draw your own rectangle on the live chart — dynamic multiplier calculated instantly | Price line passes end-to-end through the drawn rectangle |
| **Classic Mode** | Pick UP or DOWN + multiplier + expiry time | Price at expiry is above (UP) or below (DOWN) the strike price |
| **Blitz Mode** | Pay a one-time on-chain entry fee | All multipliers boosted 2× for the 1-min active window |

## Slide 7 — Market Opportunity

| Market | Size | Signal |
|--------|------|--------|
| Binary options / prediction | **$27.56B (2025) → ~$116B by 2034** (19.8% CAGR) | Long-term structural demand for fast binary outcome trading |
| Crypto prediction markets | **$45B+ annual volume** (Polymarket, Kalshi) | Liquidity appetite for oracle-driven prediction already proven |
| Crypto derivatives | **$86T+ annually (2025)** | Massive speculative trader base looking for simpler instruments |
| Global crypto users | **590M+** | Reachable audience with wallets already set up |

**Bynomo's wedge:** The only product that combines fast oracle-settled binary rounds + transparent settlement + beginner-friendly UX + 12 chains. The category has no incumbent.

---

## Slide 8 — Business Model

### Three Revenue Streams

| Stream | Mechanism | Rate |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **Platform fees** | 10% on every deposit + 10% on every withdrawal | Applied to all 12 chains |
| **House edge** | Multipliers set below fair-odds parity (e.g. 1.9× at 52.6% break-even) | Every losing bet is net revenue |
| **Blitz entry fees** | One-time flat fee per Blitz window, paid on-chain directly to fee collector | Per chain: 1 SOL · 0.1 BNB · 50 SUI · 400 XLM · 150 XTZ · 50 NEAR · 1500 STRK |

### Revenue Projections

| Monthly Bet Volume | Expected Monthly Revenue |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| $5M | $250K – $500K |
| $20M | $400K – $2.0M |

### Unit Economics

#### How Revenue Is Generated Per User

```
User deposits 1 SOL ($185)
  ├── 10% deposit fee  →  $18.50 to Bynomo                ← Rail 1
  └── $166.50 credited to Bynomo balance

User plays (house edge ~3% per bet cycle)
  └── ~$5–15 captured from betting activity              ← Rail 2

User withdraws remaining balance
  └── 10% withdrawal fee  →  ~$15 to Bynomo               ← Rail 3

Optional: Blitz entry  →  1 SOL flat fee = $185           ← Rail 4
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total Bynomo revenue (no Blitz):  ~$38  on 1 SOL deposit
Total Bynomo revenue (with Blitz): ~$223 on 1 SOL deposit
Infra cost to serve this user:    < $0.10
```

#### Three User Scenarios

| | Conservative | Base Case | Optimistic |
|-|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Avg deposit** | $50 | $150 | $400 |
| **Deposit fee (10%)** | $5 | $15 | $40 |
| **Avg withdrawal** | $40 | $120 | $350 |
| **Withdrawal fee (10%)** | $4 | $12 | $35 |
| **House edge captured** | $2 | $5 | $15 |
| **Revenue / user / month** | **~$11** | **~$32** | **~$90** |
| **Infra cost / user** | <$0.10 | <$0.10 | <$0.10 |
| **Gross margin / user** | **~$10.90** | **~$31.90** | **~$89.90** |

#### Acquisition vs Lifetime Value

| | Conservative | Base Case | Optimistic |
|-|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **CAC** (cost to acquire 1 user) | $15 | $8 | $4 |
| **Monthly revenue / user** | $11 | $32 | $90 |
| **Months to recover CAC** | 1.4 mo | 0.25 mo | <2 weeks |
| **LTV (12-month active user)** | $132 | $384 | $1,080 |
| **LTV / CAC** | **~9×** | **~48×** | **~270×** |

> CAC drops toward $0 as the referral flywheel, viral X launch, and per-chain ecosystem blitz generate organic signups. Every organic user is **pure profit from day 1**.

#### Why the Math Gets Better at Scale

| Volume | Monthly Revenue | Key Driver |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| 1,000 active users | $11K – $90K | Early adopters, higher CAC |
| 10,000 active users | $110K – $900K | Referral loops kicking in, CAC falling |
| 100,000 active users | $1.1M – $9M | Organic flywheel, CAC near $0 |
| Infra cost at 100K users | ~$10K | Vercel + Supabase serverless — nearly flat |

## Slide 9 — Competitive Landscape

Bynomo is the only production product offering oracle-settled binary rounds at **5s–1m timeframes across 12 blockchains in a single UI**. It sits at the intersection of three large markets but is a direct substitute for none of them — the category is entirely vacant at the Web3 level.

| Segment | Examples | Why They Can't Compete |
|---------|----------|------------------------|
| **Web2 binary options** | Binomo, IQ Option, Quotex | Opaque pricing, algorithmically rigged outcomes, no on-chain settlement; users do not custody funds. Their business model depends on opacity — they cannot go transparent. |
| **Crypto prediction markets** | Polymarket, Kalshi, Azuro | Event/outcome markets ("Will X happen?"), not sub-minute price binary options. Resolution takes hours or days, not 5s–1m. Architecturally incompatible with fast rounds. |
| **Crypto derivatives (CEX)** | Binance Futures, Bybit, OKX | Leveraged perpetuals with funding rates and liquidation risk. No fixed-expiry binary product. Regulatory overhead prevents fast pivots. |
| **On-chain options / DeFi** | Dopex, Lyra, Premia | Standard calls/puts with complex UX, high gas, long settlement. No simple "price up/down in 30s" binary product. |
| **Fast trading dapps** | Euphoria Fi | Mobile-first perps on a single chain — no fixed-expiry timeframes, no binary options loop. Building multi-chain from scratch = 6–12 months minimum. |
| **Web3 binary options** | — | No established on-chain binary options dapp exists at production level. **Bynomo fills this gap entirely.** |

---

## Slide 10 — Go-To-Market

| **DeFi-native traders** | Options/perps/DEX users seeking 5s–1m high-frequency instruments | X/Twitter, DeFi Discord/Telegram, KOLs |
